    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>These domino cookies are a chewy chocolate cookie made with black cocoa and white chocolate chips - think Oreo vibes!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract or vanilla paste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup black cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup white chocolate chips</li>
        <li>extra white chocolate, chopped, for topping (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat butter, white sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, and salt together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes (if using melted butter instead, just mix until combined). Add egg and egg yolk and mix until incorporated.</li>
        <li>Add flour, black cocoa powder, and baking soda and mix on low speed until a soft dough comes together. Add white chocolate chips and mix until just combined. Wrap the dough in plastic (I usually take it out of the bowl) and refrigerate until firm, at least 2 hours, and preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>Portion the cookies: divide and roll the dough into 12 balls, about 60grams each, or 3 leveled tablespoons. If using extra chopped white chocolate, press several pieces into each dough ball and place them in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Place cookies on the prepared baking sheet. You can fit 6 to 8 on a half sheet, leaving some space for spreading between each.</li>
        <li>Bake until cookies have spread and centers no longer look shiny and wet, 13 to 14 minutes. Bang the pan carefully on the counter 1 or 2 times to flatten cookies a bit, giving them chewier centers. Let cool on the pan. Enjoy!</li>
