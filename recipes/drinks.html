    <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
    <p>Enjoy the fair at home with this apple-flavor slushy. To make it a cocktail, stir 1/2 to 1 ounce apple brandy, such as applejack or Calvados, into each serving after blending.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12-ounce) container frozen apple juice concentrate</li>
        <li>3 cups ice</li>
        <li>1 cup cold water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple pie spice, plus more for garnish (optional)</li>
        <li>air fried apple slices, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat air fryer to 200 degrees F (93 degrees C). Coat 1/8-inch-thick apple slices with cooking spray; arrange in an even layer in air fryer basket. Cook, turning every 5 to 10 minutes, until starting to brown and dry out and edges curl, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer cooked apples to a paper towel (apples will crisp as they cool).</li>
        <li>Combine apple juice concentrate, ice, water, lemon juice, and apple pie spice in a blender; blend until mixture reaches desired consistency. Garnish with air-fried apple slices and additional apple pie spice.</li>
    </ol>
